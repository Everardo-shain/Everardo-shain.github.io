Global University Program: Tomato Harvesting Robot Challenge

Project in collaboration with Mondragon Unibertsitatea, Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey campuses Puebla and Queretaro. 

My team and I worked on the End-Effector Subsystem where we designed and built a 3D-printed prototype of a robot gripper capable of collecting tomatoes using as sensors and actuators a limit switch, a potentiometer and a stepper motor. 

I had the specific task of writing the code of the embedded system that controlled its movement using an Arduino UNO. 

We programmed an UR10e industrial robot to follow a certain trajectory, mounted the gripper and tested the whole system which successfully completed the tasks of collecting a tomato and placing it on a container. 

I improved my collaborative skills by working in person with my 4 teammates and by also being in touch with all the other teams from different campuses on their progress.
